# How to Add Your Profile Image

## Current Status
Your portfolio now shows a professional placeholder with your initials "SP" in a gradient circle.

## To Replace with Your Actual Image:

### Step 1: Save Your Image
1. Right-click on the cyberpunk image you shared
2. Save it as `profile.jpg` in the same folder as your HTML files
3. Make sure the filename is exactly `profile.jpg` (lowercase)

### Step 2: Update the HTML
Replace this line in `index.html`:
```html
<div class="profile-placeholder">
    <span class="profile-initials">SP</span>
</div>
```

With this:
```html
<img src="profile.jpg" alt="Surya Prakash - Cloud DevOps Engineer" class="profile-image">
```

## Alternative Image Sources
If the original image doesn't work, you can:
1. Use any professional headshot saved as `profile.jpg`
2. Create a new image using AI tools
3. Use a professional photo from LinkedIn
4. Keep the current placeholder (it looks professional too!)

## File Requirements
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Size: Recommended 400x400px or larger
- Filename: Must be exactly `profile.jpg`
- Location: Same folder as index.html

The placeholder looks professional and works great until you're ready to add your actual photo!
